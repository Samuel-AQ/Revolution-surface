# Revolution surface
## Description
This application allows you to draw a 2D shape and transform it into a 3D shape
## How to use it
The application will start with a information screen of how to use it. There you can see the controls and learn about its functionalities. This are the features:
* Press 'i' to run the application or to see the information screen again
* Press 'r' to reset the application values and start again a shape
* Press the arrow keys to rotate the 3D figure
* Click and drag the mouse to move the figure through the screen
* Use de mouse wheel the zoom the figure

The code tries to create vertices according to the points drawed by the user creating the desire 3D shape. It's important to draw only in the right side of the panel touching the middle line twice, one indicating the first point of the shape and another indicating the last point of it.
## Implentation decisions
Through all the development it was primary target to write easy to read code in order to add information avoiding the overuse of comments.
Following the Jakob Nielsen principles I tried to create an application that is easy to use, makes the user feel the control at every moment, feels pretty, minimalist and enjoyable,
helps the user in every moment they need it and prevent the errors in case the could happen telling the user how to fix them.
Color decisions:
* The red color has been kept to inform the user about possible errors
* The blue color has been picked in order to make the user feel like everything they're doing is ok as it's present in mostly of the application
